# Tasks Roadmap

Tasks don’t always have binary states, they’re not necessarily just `To-do` or `Done`, maybe you’re working on it right now or it’s a pending review. Modern task managers are just digital to-do lists, but your modern life is not so binary. That’s where Tasks can give your productivity a boost! 

# Latest Update 
`1.1.4`

This is a big one. Thank you to everyone for your feedback and suggestions. We listen and we act on it!
This update consists of the following changes:
- Redesigned home screen to allow global filters which can be customised in the app’s new global settings
- Drag and drop support has been enhanced and improved thanks to your reports
- Cursor support has been enhanced so go on and hover around with it
- Drag and drop a multiple tasks into a tag, priority or task type and it will add them to the task
- Added support for rich links
- Fixes issues with recurring reminders
- Better design for the iPad kanban screen for a richer experience 
- Allows a participant to leave a shared project
- Project detail screen now allows you to collapse headers to help you focus on the tags you want
